            "As the ecosystem of tools and agents available for integration with Large Language Models "
            "(LLMs) expands, selecting the most relevant tools for a given task becomes critical for "
            "efficiency and improving interaction quality. This paper explores the use of vector-based search and embeddings "
            "to pre-select tools from a large pool (e.g., 100+ tools), ensuring a more targeted and "
            "contextually relevant interaction. Additionally, this approach can be extended to agent "
            "orchestration systems, such as OpenAI's Swarm [1], to optimize handoffs between agents in complex multi-agent scenarios."
        ),
        "1. Introduction": (
            "Modern LLMs are increasingly being augmented with external tools to extend their capabilities, "
            "such as retrieving real-time information, performing complex calculations, or manipulating structured "
            "data. While maintaining a large pool of tools does not inherently create computational overhead, passing "
            "an excessive number of tools into the LLM can lead to context length constraints and inefficiencies. "
            "Efficiently narrowing down the pool of tools to those most relevant to a user's query is crucial to ensure "
            "seamless interaction and reduce token usage.\n\n"
            "Vector-based search, leveraging embeddings to represent tools and user queries in a shared high-dimensional "
            "space, provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for this pre-selection. Techniques such as Hypothetical "
            "Document Embeddings (HyDE) [2] can further enhance the matching process by generating hypothetical intermediate "
            "outputs to better align queries with tool capabilities.\n\n"
            "In addition, systems like OpenAI's Swarm, which orchestrate the actions of multiple specialized agents, face "
            "similar challenges of scalability and relevance. Embedding-based approaches can be extended to optimize agent "
            "selection in these multi-agent environments."

                    "into embeddings using transformer-based models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings or Sentence-BERT). The tool representation "
                    "may vary, but the core idea is to capture the tool's functionality, parameters, and potential use cases in a way that is "
                    "easy to understand, and create a relevant embedding. The embedding process could include:"

                    "Document Embeddings (HyDE) technique generates a plausible response to the query and embeds this response. The final "
                    "query embedding can then be a blend of the direct query embedding and the HyDE-enhanced embedding, improving alignment "
                    "with tool capabilities."

                "5.1 Results": (
                    "The pre-selection obviously results in a very high reduction in terms of token usage, because reducing from 100 "
                    "to 5 tools would reduce the token usage by 95% for most queries if we consider the tools to have around the same size in tokens. "
                    "The interesting part is attempting to maintain a high selection accuracy while reducing the token usage, which makes it possible to run "
                    "in smaller models.\n\n"
                    "The results show that the vector-based approach is able to maintain a high selection accuracy even when the number of tools is increased. "
                    "In the majority of the test runs, the expected tool was in the top 5 results. This accounts for more than 94% of the test queries. "
                    "Using HyDE, the selection accuracy was able to reach higher accuracy, sometimes more than 98%, for runs of 400 queries, especially when the queries were trickier.\n\n"
                    "For example, if the query was \"Hash the contents: 'How's the weather today?'\", the expected tool would be "
                    "a hashing tool, instead of a weather tool. These are the cases where the HyDE technique is better than just using the "
                    "plain query embedding.\n\n"
                    "The results were obtained by running over multiple runs of 400 queries with 100 tools. The code for the experiment, "

                    "potential sampling bias as these may not fully represent real-world use cases. Nevertheless, the findings demonstrate "
                    "that the vector-based approach successfully maintains high selection accuracy as the toolset scales, while achieving "
                    "substantial reductions in token utilization.\n\n"
                    "The integration of HyDE in the query embedding pipeline introduces additional "
                    "computational overhead but yields improved selection accuracy. With appropriate prompt engineering, the technique "
                    "demonstrates robust performance even when using smaller models.\n\n"
                    "Smaller models like 3B parameters still result in a good selection accuracy, which makes it possible to run HyDE "
                    "at an higher token/s and increase the selection accuracy.\n\n"
                    "Further research opportunities include evaluating the approach using a more comprehensive, manually curated dataset "
                    "of tools and queries. Additionally, empirical validation through end-to-end testing with LLM-based tool execution "
                    "would provide valuable insights into the practical impact of reducing the tool context from 100 to 5 options. It could also "
                    "be interesting to normalize the description of the tools in regards to what the HyDE generates, which would increase the "
                    "selection accuracy even more."

            "Vector-based search and embedding techniques provide an efficient mechanism for narrowing down large pools of tools or "
            "agents in LLM-driven systems. By leveraging techniques like HyDE and embedding-based similarity, these systems dynamically "
            "identify the most relevant tools or agents for a given task.\n\n"
            "This approach has been successfully implemented in real-world systems to pre-select tools that are passed into the LLM or, "
            "in some cases, to outright select the best tool for the task."
